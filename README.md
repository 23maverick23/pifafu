### :telescope: 2020 goal
I want to make a little game this year. I'm currently working on a small gameboy game with [**@tfgrimes**](https://github.com/tfgrimes) using [GBStudio.dev](https://github.com/chrismaltby/gb-studio), which is an awesome game creator tool that makes it really easy to design a game if you're primarily focusing on the art and story (like myself). I'm hoping to print this on a cartridge when I'm done so you can actually experience it on a Gameboy!
